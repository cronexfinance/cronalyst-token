# $CRONALYST

## Safest Token on CRO

Deploying this project on CRO to support the @CROnalyst (https://t.me/cronalyst) effort on CRO chain to identify scammers and investigate rugs on the Chain. 

Contract for $CRONALYST is forked from $CROGECOIN on CRO. The $CROGECOIN contract is already audited and I intend on fixing the potential risks highlighted in their audit report: https://github.com/AuditRateTech/Smart-Contract-Audits/blob/main/Crogecoin_0xC4a174cCb5fb54a6721e11e0Ca961e42715023F9.pdf

## $CRONALYST - Tokenomics

Total Taxes while buying and selling the token are same and immutable externally after deployement. This safeguards the token from being rugged or honeypotted in the future by increasing the taxes insanely.

- Liquidity Tax of 1%
- Team Tax of 1%
- Marketing Tax of 5%

There are no functions to modify the taxes after deployement.
